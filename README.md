A small experiment to detox your search result on various platform and make them think that you are somebody else üòú


## Why this exist? ü§î
I'm not against Google, I'm just in favor of privacy. Most people don't take it seriously, including developers. Big gaints create your personality profiles on the basis of your search and use that to manipulate you.

Idea of this project is to trick their algorithms by doing fake searches, that may result in to these gaints knowing you less.

## How to contribute ü§ì
There are two ways in which you can contribute in this project.

#### Adding fake search results
To be transparent, that we don't save any data, this project doesn't have any database. We have a `data.json` file in assests folder that is used for generating fake search results. 

I encourage you guys to add some fake personalities or fake search results and generate a pull request.
